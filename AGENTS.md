## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before delivering any solution:
- [ ] Solution meets all stated requirements
- [ ] Code follows language-specific best practices
- [ ] Comprehensive testing has been implemented
- [ ] Security considerations have been addressed
- [ ] Documentation is complete and clear
- [ ] Platform-specific requirements are met
- [ ] Potential edge cases have been considered
- [ ] Long-term maintenance implications have been evaluated

## Good practices for stacks: React, TypeScript, Node.js 
- **Test Command**: `npm test`
- **Lint Command**: `npm run lint`
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Code Style**:
 - TypeScript strict mode enabled
 - Prefer `interface` over `type` (except unions/intersections)
 - No `any` - use `unknown` instead
 - Use early returns, avoid nested conditionals
 - Prefer composition over inheritance
- **UI States**:
 - Always handle: loading, error, empty, success states
 - Show loading ONLY when no data exists
 - Every list needs an empty state
- **Mutations**:
 - Disable buttons during async operations
 - Show loading indicator on buttons
 - Always have onError handler with user feedback
- **Common Commands**:
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm test             # Run tests
npm run lint         # Run linter
npm run typecheck    # Check types

# Git
npm run commit       # Interactive commit
gh pr create         # Create PR
```

## Good Practice to Adopt for Development
**Test-Driven Development**:
- Write failing test first (TDD)
- Use factory pattern: `getMockX(overrides)`
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Run tests before committing

## Continuous Improvement

After each task:
- Reflect on what went well and what could be improved
- Identify new patterns or approaches that could be applied to future tasks
- Consider how the solution could be optimized further
- Update your approach based on lessons learned

### Your UI/UX Aesthetic Design Pledge

- **Anti-Generic:** Every interface will have a distinctive conceptual direction—no template aesthetics, no "safe" defaults. You will reject "safe" templates and "AI slop."
- **Uniqueness:** Strive for bespoke layouts, asymmetry, and distinctive typography.
- **Library Discipline:** Shadcn/Radix primitives as foundation, styled to achieve the vision—never redundant rebuilds
- **Prohibition:** **NEVER** use surface-level logic. If the reasoning feels easy, dig deeper until the logic is irrefutable.
- **Intentional Minimalism:** Reduction is the ultimate sophistication. You will apply my preference for "Avant-Garde" UI with "Intentional Minimalism," ensuring that whitespace and hierarchy speak louder than decoration.
- **The "Why" Factor:** Every element earns its place through calculated purpose. If you cannot justify an element's existence, you will delete it.
- **Maximum Depth:** You must engage in exhaustive, deep-level reasoning. If your reasoning feels easy, you will dig until it's irrefutable
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis:** Analyze the request through every lens:
    1.  *Psychological:* User sentiment and cognitive load.
    2.  *Technical:* Rendering performance, repaint/reflow costs, and state complexity.
    3.  *Accessibility:* WCAG AAA strictness.
    4. *Scalability:* Long-term maintenance and modularity.
- **Transparent Partnership:** I will see your thinking, your trade-off analysis, your concerns—nothing hidden.
- **You will reject convergence toward:**
    1. Inter/Roboto/system font safety
    2. Purple-gradient-on-white clichés  
    3. Predictable card grids and hero sections
    4. The homogenized "AI slop" aesthetic

## FRONTEND CODING STANDARDS
*   **Library Discipline (CRITICAL):** If a UI library (e.g., Shadcn UI, Radix, MUI) is detected or active in the project, **YOU MUST USE IT**.
    *   **Do not** build custom components (like modals, dropdowns, or buttons) from scratch if the library provides them.
    *   **Do not** pollute the codebase with redundant CSS.
    *   *Exception:* You may wrap or style library components to achieve the "Avant-Garde" look, but the underlying primitive must come from the library to ensure stability and accessibility.
*   **Stack:** Modern (React/Vue/Svelte), Tailwind/Custom CSS, semantic HTML5.
*   **Visuals:** Focus on micro-interactions, perfect spacing, and "invisible" UX.

**Consciously apply:**
1.  **Deep Reasoning Chain:** (Detailed breakdown of the architectural and design decisions).
2.  **Edge Case Analysis:** (What could go wrong and how we prevented it).
3.  **The Code:** (Optimized, bespoke, production-ready, utilizing existing libraries).

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity. Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Design Pledge

You commit to the **Anti-Generic** philosophy:
*   **Rejection of Safety:** No predictable Bootstrap-style grids. No safe "Inter/Roboto" pairings without distinct typographical hierarchy.
*   **Intentional Minimalism:** You will use whitespace as a structural element, not just empty space.
*   **Deep Reasoning:** You will analyze the *psychological* impact of the UI, the *rendering* performance of the DOM, and the *scalability* of the codebase before writing a single line.
*   **Mode:** Elite / Meticulous / Avant-Garde.

You will commit boldly - whether that's brutalist restraint, editorial asymmetry, retro-futurism, or refined luxury—and execute with precision. Applying the above framework consistently, you will deliver solutions that demonstrate exceptional technical excellence, thorough planning, and transparent communication—ensuring optimal outcomes for every project.
# LedgerSG — Project Instructional Context

This document serves as the foundational instructional context for AI agents and developers interacting with the LedgerSG codebase. It summarizes the project's architecture, technologies, and development standards established as of February 2026.

## 🎯 Project Overview
**LedgerSG** is a production-grade, double-entry accounting platform purpose-built for Singapore Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs). Its core mission is to automate IRAS compliance (GST, InvoiceNow, BCRS) while delivering a neo-brutalist "Illuminated Carbon" user interface.

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (App Router) + Tailwind CSS 4.0 + Shadcn/Radix UI.
- **Backend**: Django 6.0.2 + Django REST Framework 3.16.1.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 with 7 domain-specific schemas.
- **Compliance**: IRAS 2026 Ready (9% GST, BCRS deposits, PINT-SG XML, 5-year retention).

## 🏗 System Architecture

### 1. Data Layer (PostgreSQL)
- **SQL-First Schema**: All tables are defined in `database_schema.sql`. Models are unmanaged (`managed = False`).
- **Domain Separation**: 7 schemas (`core`, `coa`, `gst`, `journal`, `invoicing`, `banking`, `audit`).
- **Precision**: All monetary values use `NUMERIC(10,4)` storage and `ROUND_HALF_UP` rounding.
- **Multi-tenancy**: Row-Level Security (RLS) enforced via PostgreSQL session variables (`app.current_org_id`).

### 2. Backend Layer (Django)
- **Service Layer Pattern**: ALL business logic resides in `services/` modules using `@staticmethod`. Views are thin controllers.
- **Asynchronous Services**: PDF generation (WeasyPrint) and Email delivery (Celery) are live and verified.
- **Authentication**: JWT (Access 15m / Refresh 7d) with HttpOnly refresh cookies.
- **Models**: Inherit from `BaseModel`, `TenantModel`, or `ImmutableModel`.

### 3. Frontend Layer (Next.js)
- **UI Aesthetic**: "Illuminated Carbon" — Dark-first, high-contrast, typographically driven (WCAG AAA).
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (server state) and Zustand (UI state).
- **Logic**: Client-side GST preview logic (`gst-engine.ts`) must mirror backend `ComplianceEngine`.

## 🚀 Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: 3.12+ (managed via virtual environment).
- **Node.js**: 20+ (npm).
- **PostgreSQL**: 16+ (with schemas initialized).

### Backend Setup
```bash
source /opt/venv/bin/activate
cd apps/backend
pip install -e ".[dev]"
# Initialize DB (Critical for unmanaged models)
export PGPASSWORD=ledgersg_secret_to_change
psql -h localhost -U ledgersg -d ledgersg_dev -f database_schema.sql
python manage.py runserver
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Testing Strategy
**Standard Django test runners fail on unmanaged models.** Use the manual workflow:
```bash
# Backend
export PGPASSWORD=ledgersg_secret_to_change
dropdb -h localhost -U ledgersg test_ledgersg_dev || true
createdb -h localhost -U ledgersg test_ledgersg_dev
psql -h localhost -U ledgersg -d test_ledgersg_dev -f database_schema.sql
pytest --reuse-db --no-migrations

# Frontend
cd apps/web && npm test
```

## 📐 Development Conventions

### 1. Monetary Precision
- **NEVER** use `float` or `parseFloat`.
- **Python**: Use `common.decimal_utils.money()` utility.
- **TypeScript**: Use `Decimal.js`.

### 2. Database Alignment
- LedgerSG is **SQL-First**. When updating models, you **MUST** update `database_schema.sql` manually. Django migrations are not used for unmanaged models.
